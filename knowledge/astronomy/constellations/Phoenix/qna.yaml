- question: What notable Deep-sky objects are in the constellation?
  answer: | Lying within the bounds of the constellation is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, making it one of the most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012.[56] Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.
- question:  What notable black hole is in the constellation?
  answer: | The first intermediate-mass black hole HLX-1, is within the galaxy ESO 243-49, which is within the constellation
- question: What is the brightest star in the constellation?
